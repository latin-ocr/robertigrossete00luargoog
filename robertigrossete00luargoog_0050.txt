the consecration of Ricbsrd of Wendover, Bishop of
Rochester‚ at St. Gregory’s‚ Canterbury.

This strenuous visitetion stirred up opposition3 and ¹²³⁰·
in the following year the serious misunderstanding
with his chapter, which became a quarrel which lasted
for six years, and was at length only quieted by the
decision of the Pope himself, took its rise. The
bishop felt it to be very unsatisfactory, thet while so
much in the diocese wanted a thorough reform, and
therefore he required the sid of all the clergy of his
diocese, there should exist an imperium ia imperto, s
body of men joined by common interests, who declined
to submit to his jurisdiction, and who besides might

as one that had never been previously made from
the earliest times. No doubt an easy-going bishop
such as Grosseteste’s predecessor might be willing to
let things take their chance, and so to save himself
the trouble of visitation 3 but they had now to do with
a very different prelate. The case, while dragging on
its slow length, excited a great deal of attention in
the country, each diocese feeling that these prooeedings

no little scandal was excited by its long continuance.

Thus we find the Dean and Chapter of Salisbnry
(Grosseteste had been, bs it remembered, Archdeacon

of Wilts), expressing this to the bishop himself, and

'fisfflffi one of Grosseteste’s most intimate friends, says that
pres. many with reason take ill this terrible dissension be·

tween the bishop and his subordinates.

P. 252 At first it appeared esif the question would be

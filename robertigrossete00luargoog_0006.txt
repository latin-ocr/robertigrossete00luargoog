ὈΝ the aoth of J anuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls

submitted to the Treasury a proposal sor the publication

' of materials for the History of this Country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange·
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being

given, in the first instance, to such materials as were most
scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical document
to be edited should be treated in the 'same way as if the .
editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and for this

ι, purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and ·
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a brief

. account of the life and times of the author, and any
¹ remarks necessary to explain the chronology 3 but no other
note or comment was to be allowed, except what might be
necessary to establish the correctness of the text.

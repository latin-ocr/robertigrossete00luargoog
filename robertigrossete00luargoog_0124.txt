umus OF BISHOP sucessum cxv

ss the fifth commsndment spplies more strongly to spiritual
thsn to ustursl parents. A biehop, therefore, must visit
ell in his diocese who ere not erempted, es e shepherd does
his flock. Iudeed,s postor connot do his duty without
visitiug. From Ezekiel we see iu whut the foediug ο
ilock connisos, there is ο differenee between visor aud
chilotor. 'l'he deon, who slweys resides in the oothedrul,
oenuot be its visitor, nor, if he could, would thet be eny
resson for excludiug the bishop. This is shown by rericus
exemplos. What the odveuteges of frequent visitetion ore
S. Bernerd hes shown. It oppeers theu thot the bishop’s
power to visitis olwoys reserved to him, except in speeiul
ceses ol exemption from the Pope, because, however sn
inferior moy limit this power, he cannot do ewoy with it.
This is shown by reference to various scriptur-el exemplos,
-Jeoob leeding Loben’s sheep3 Jooob’e sons; the elder
sou iu the persble ol the prodigal son, doc. Agein, ecele-
sisstieel discipline ss well oscxhortstionis osten necessary,
os oppeors from the osse of David keeping the lion uud the
beerfrom his flock, lor he would not hove boen hindered
in delending his flock by the shepherds under him ; neither
cen the bishops by their subject pestere. Resides, the
subject shepherds ere inferior in power; so the power of
the chapter in repressing vice is inferior to thet of tho
bishop. An argument is drawn from Samuel's circuit,
who was to the Israeliten whut the Pope is in the Ohurch,
eud euch bishop in his own diocese. As tho sun gives
light to the moon end sters, ιο the Pope imperis power to
the bishops, ond tho bishops to their iuferiors in esch
diocese. They osu no more hinder the bishops, then the
moon eud the sture the sun’s shining. Another argument
is drswn from Adam und Eue, Ere being ο type of the
assistente to the bishops. As ο husband desires to heve
his wife’s person free from sll stein, so does the bishop the
rouls os ull his diocese, und especially the csthedrel chup-
ter. Agein, to teke sn exemplo from ort end ertifioers,
ο worker in gold or bross ought to be oble to know their
difference end to detect impurities, eud so tho bishop in
the “ ert ol' erts.’' The bishops ore oleo wutchmen, eud
this involves discipline ss well es exhortation, us appears
from wericus exemplos. Wetchmen erc plscod in vine-
yerds to protect the vinos; sud though the charge belongs
totheheed wotchmon, yet he is plessed if tho inferiore euti-
cipste him in the wuteh, eud he must seo that thoy do their

duty. Soulsothebishop. Agein,heis espiritnslphysi· ⁴

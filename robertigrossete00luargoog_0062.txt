ggffl Nicholae¹‚ a Greek, and clerk 01 the abbey of S. Albanh, ·
employed himself in translating the “ Testamenta 01
“ the Twelve Patriarehs,” a spurious work, the know-
' ledge of which he owed to John 01 Besingstoke‚ arch-
deacon 01 Leicester, who had seen 01 heard of the hook
at Athens. How great 0 sensation was produced by
the publication 01 this worthless book is shown by the

teste), is very strong with reference 10 the king’s oon-
duet. We may also refer 10 this year the letter 01
Grosseteste in anewer 10 the Bishop of Woroester’s
letter, aeking 101 advice as to whether he should follow
the king into Franea ss he hed requested him to do.
His affection 101 Adam de Marisoo, and his respect for
his judgment, are shown by the hesitation to give 0
final answer 10 this until he hed seen him. He seems to

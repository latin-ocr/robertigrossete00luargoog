cion, who must inspect the physicians under him. In all
orte the master must know all the circumstances of the art
sees to correct errore, end how can this be denied in the
‘⁴ nrt of artsf’' The bishops are like parents and narses
towards their children, and though the inferiore may be
themselves parents also, yet they are sons, and therefore
subject ιο the bishop. 'Ihen in Persdise, though God gave
it in charge te angele, yet Himself punished Adem's sin.
Other instances from Scriptura What the duties of
bishops in their dioceses are. Ezekiel's vision used as en
example ιο them; J eremiah a type ef them as pillars of
the ohuroh. 'l'he commission given ιο inferiers no more
takes away the bishop’s power than Christ’e ιο His apo-
etlcs took awey His. There are many ample proefs in
Scripture, which is the direct command of God No civil
law or custom ought te interfere; indeed no eustom can
be alleged, for eustom is the habit of a lawful action, and
the absence of visitetien is e positive evil; nor is the
ebsenoe of visitation liberty. What liberty really is Philo
J udoeus hee shown. The ehepter cannot think themselves
too great to be visited, as appears from our Irord's own
submissim, ιο sey nothing ef otham, ner con they be free
from all need of e physician, when we find in fleriptnre
that none have sinncd se grievously as priests; and even

· if they never go wrong, they may do so, and therefore
require visitetion ιο keep thern right.

When the bishop comesto his chnrch thc bells ought to
be rung ιο give notice of his arrival ιο the people, even if
he returns within a short interval, es scarcely a day pasees
without some one's needing absolution from the bishop.

Obedienee is due ιο fleshly fathers, and so much more ιο
spiritual ; and the bishop is much more of afather towards
tho dean and chapter than the dean is towards the chapter.
God listened ιο J oshua's word, and stayed the sun. What
pride, then, must theirs be who refuse ιο listen to God's
word, who has appointed the higher powers to be ebeyed!

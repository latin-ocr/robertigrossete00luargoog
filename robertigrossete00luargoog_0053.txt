the whole question to the Bishop of Worcester and
the Archdeecons of Worceeter and Sudbury, who were ’
either to decide themselves on the whole question,
without allowing any appeol, or aster the cause had
been sufficiently investigated, by a certain day to be
named by the Pope, to submit it to him to be finally
settled, each psrty in the meantime ceaeing from
exercising any visitatoriel power. The bishop seems to

ference‚ writes ss a thorough partizan of the canons;
ond though not eteting the whole arrangement quite
comectly‚ comments on this last clause es being unfair
to the canons. “‚”For he says, “the bishop never did

‘¹ any visitation over them3 and they regretted ex-
“ tremely thet they had put over themselves such a
“ bishop of so humble en origin, end this they puh-
“ lickly expressed in the bishop's presence. After a
“great disturbance and heavy expenses spent to no
“purpose onboth sides, en appeal was made to the
“ Pope, the chapter appointing Odo de Kilkenny as
“ their proctorss’ It would appear from this that

the arbitration‚ thus decided upon, proved c failure, Μὴ

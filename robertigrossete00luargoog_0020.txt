that lmew Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus ¹,-
it may be well to produce some few contemporary
opinions. Lot us first tuke Roget Bneou, himself
⁰⁴ probably second in universality to none He says of
him, “Solus unus scivit scientiae, ut Lincolniensis epis·
“ copus'’ (Opem Tertium, ed. Brewer, p. 33); or again,

“ Solus dominus Robertus, propter longitudinem vitre
“ et vias mirabiles quibus usus est, prae aliis homi·
“ nibus scivit scientias '' (camenarum Stadii, p. 472).
· Or to take a very different writer, Tyssyngton (in

⁰¹¹· Shirley's radente· Zizoraiorucoc, p. 135) speaks Οἵ,

“ Lineolniensis: cujus comparatio ad omnes doctores
“ modernos est velut comparatio solis ad lunam
“ quando eclipsutur.'' And indeed, though his life, as
Bacon remarks, was along one, yet the number and
variety of the works attributed to him make it
difficult to conceive how a man of such active habita
and in such constant occupatiori could have found
timeto master, far more to write, so much Doubtlesa
many books and tracis have been fathered upon him,
cs is so continuolly the case with voluminous writers
of the middle eges. Thus, the tract Dc Da‘ynitote
conditionis hamorem, which he himself quotes (p. 10)
as if from S. Augustino, is included in some lists of hia
works So clso are the Oculus Morclia of Arohbishop
Peccham, and the Stimulos Ooraacicctiec, which was
written in the middle of the following century, by
Richard Rolle os Hempole (a writer who in his turn
has had e large proportion of the literature of his
time attributed to him); while, on the other hand, the
Parvus Octo (or Pety Coton, es Fabyan, p. 336, calle
it,) is found in some MSS. of the twelfth century.

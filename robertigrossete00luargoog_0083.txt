September, still persevering in his endeavoms3 but at
length finding it hopeless, returned homewards, and
reached England, “ tristis et vacuue‚'’ about Michaelmos

day. At first he appears to have been utterly broken
down and dispirited, and determined on resigning hie
bishoprick ¹, and actually did es a preliminary, place the
administration of his official duties into the hands of his
friend and official, Robert de Matisco. The immediate

vacent chunches and afterwards thrust unworthy
persons into them, he suspended his design and waited
anxiously till he should see his wey more clearly.

lies on him, end adds that it isnot lawful to carry
out that which would render him froe. I em not clear
as to what this can refer. The Ianeroost Chronicle
speaks of his offering to resign at the Romen court ¹.
But it is not likely that the Pope would have
interfered to prevent him (and indeed his contemplated
resignation was afterhis return); nor, from what Paris

that the other bishops or his friends had influenoe
enough to show him thet his duty lay more in

meeting his difficulties than in flying from them, and

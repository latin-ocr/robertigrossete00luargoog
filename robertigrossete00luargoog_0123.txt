From the 111110001101111010 110101, we leam that thero
are different kinds 01 ecelesiastical powers, Moses being
the type 01 Christian prelatas. In appointing 1111111111 10
help him, he did not give up or diminish his power, but
reserved to himself the more importent 01111. ’1111 same
is true 01 the prelatos, as appears by the example 011
mirror reflecting the sun's rays. What the inferior power
can do, the superior can, though 101 the contram lor
inierim· judges heve only individual cases committed 1ο
them, since, 11 1 whole diocese or chapter goes wrong,

. only the prelato 011 judge it. To the prelatesistherelore

reserved the J'udgment and correction of ull cases, in-
dividual end universal, their coadjutore sharing in their
burdens, but not diminishing their power. 'lhe Pope and
the bishops correspond 10 110101 and hia assistants; and
111111 the Pope 11 to the whole Choreb, thetis each bishop
to his own diocese, he taking helpers‘sor his work, and they
others 1011111111, and so down to the lowest, many things
still being reserved 101 the superior power. An objection
deduced from the instances 01 11111 deaus and cistercien
abbets being able to visit their affiliated honses, which yet
tho bishcps to whom those abbate are subject cannot, is
enswered by showing thia is a special privilege from the
Pope. Unless then the dean and chapter have 1 special
exemption from the Pope, they must be subject to the
bishop’s visitation, 11 he cannot diminish his own powers,
aa is shown by several examples. The Pope cannot dimi·
nish his power which he 1111 from Christ, nor 1 bishop his
which he 1111 from the Pope, cs is shown by scriptural
examples, ep. God’s covenant with the 1111011101, which
must embrace 1110 arrangement 01 eeclesiastioal powers,

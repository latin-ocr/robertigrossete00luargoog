PREFAOE.

wm'fl

Tanau is scarcely a character in English history mo„
whose fame has been more constant both during and lgffiaoe
aster his life, than Rornae Gaossmaarn, Bishop ofnas been
Lincoln from 1235 to 1253. As wc find his advioehffi
sought universally during his lifetime‚ and bis ex·
ample spoken of aa that which almost all the other
prelatos ol his day followed, so was it also after his
death. If threnis from Rome and excommunicatione

from Canterbury fell harmlessly upon him while

alive, hia example nerved othere in subsequent years,—
as in the ease of Sewal¹, Archbishop of Yorlr,—·to
bear even worse attacks without giving way. And
probably no one has had a greater influcnce upon
English thought and English litaratme for the two

centurias which followed his time; few books will
be found that do not contain some quotations from Inu-
conwmwsls, “the great clerk Grostest” Nor even with
the change of thought that nahered in the sixteenth
century do we find his fame forgotten. Richard of
ΒεπάιιογέΒ metrical life of him was written in 1503

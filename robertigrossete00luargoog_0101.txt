fire.¹ A list and account of the MSS. that have been
used l'or the present volume will be found at the end
of the preface.

Ia editing the present volume my first idea was lo

arrange the letters in chronological order, ae far as
that could be ascertained. But ae they have been

which is the usual order in most of the other MSS„
and especially as the detes of many must be conjec-
tural, it seemed better to keep to this arrangement,
and affix in the margin the most probable dete to
each letter. Ihave, however, arranged the table of
contente in what I believe to be the truc chronological
order. The collector of these lettere evidently aimcd at
achronological arrangement, although in some casea he
is evidently wrong; and Ithink, where there is no
internal evidence, the order gives some clue to the ’
date. Resides the series of 128 letters which form the
usual collection, Ι heve only been successful in finding
three stray letters, which are all of very considerable
interest. 'l'hose printed in Brown's collection⁹ are ia,
viii, x.-xii., xvii, xxii-xxx„ xxxii.,xxxv.-xxxviii., xl.-
lvi, lxi-lxvi, lxviii, lxxi, lxxii, lxxiii—civ„ cvi-cxxvi,
cxxviii, and occupy about half the present volume.
Where Brown’s variatione were apparently those of
the lost Me, I have given them ae various readings.
Though some credit is due to him for their publi-
cation, his antiquariae knowledge was of a very low
order, ae the illustrative notes frequently display great
rgnorance.

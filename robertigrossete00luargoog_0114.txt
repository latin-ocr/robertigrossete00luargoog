On various attacks on tho liberties 01 the Ohuroh.

The king has appointed certain abbata justioes itine-
rant. Abbats ubo undertake this offioe sin grievously‚ and
so also all other ecclesiastico] persons ; and the king who
compels‚ and the prelates who do 001 resist. It is also
against the canons forfohurohmen to hold seculus 0100001-
ships. Thero aro oleo other invasions 01 tho liberties 01
the (lhnrohz ecclesiastioks have been oompelled to submit
to lay tribunale, in uhiob both the jndges compelling and
the olergy oonsonting sin; und the secular jndges add sin
to sin in determining in doubtful 00000 whether they
belong to ecclesiastioal or lay tribunals. Diseussion 01
and answer to certain objections to this. Again, the king
has prevented tho ecclesiastioal judges irom deoiding
sauses known to ba purely ecelesiastioal, and hindored
their dooisions. Prolatos too have bsen compelled to
aononnt to tho seonlar power respeoting tho right 01
patronage 10 beneficas, and their refusals to institute
persons presented. 'l'he king is thus in danger 01 resem-
bling Usziah. 'rho Oxford 0000011 has exeommunioated

Charta tho Ohuroh is to bo irae. Indead, 11100101δί0100
